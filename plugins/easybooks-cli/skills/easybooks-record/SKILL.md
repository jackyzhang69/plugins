description: Record income and expense transactions in EasyBooks — quick one-off entries and document/receipt ingestion. Parse the user's file locally (Excel/CSV/PDF/image/email/text) into Entry JSON, dry-run, confirm, then record. Idempotent on source_id so re-imports never double-record. Requires connect-easybooks first. See easybooks-capabilities for the full router and JSON shapes.

## Shared platform token (host agent — mandatory)

- Canonical durable user credential: `~/.jackyzhang.app/token/user.json` (`jz_` only).
- **One connect for the whole platform.** If this file already exists from any other official plugin, do **not** ask the human to log in again.
- On load, if `user.json` is missing but a legacy on-disk `jz_` exists (`token/user.json`, product-local config token fields), **migrate immediately** by running this product's CLI `whoami`/`doctor`/any authenticated command (load-time migrate is built in). User must feel no re-paste.
- Only when no migratable `jz_` exists: complete connect once using the token-delivery rules below. After that, every registered plugin reuses the same slot.
- Never print or log the raw token. Prefer masked doctor/whoami output.
- Do not create product-local durable token files.

## Token delivery to the host agent (connect) — LOCKED 2026-08-14

The host agent performs connect **for** the human. **Never** tell the human to open a terminal and run login commands themselves.

Accept input in this order:

1. **File containing the token (preferred).** If the human provides a filesystem path (e.g. `~/Desktop/jacky-token.txt`) or an attached/readable file whose contents are a single `jz_…` value (optional surrounding whitespace/newline only):
   - Read the file in the agent tool channel.
   - Pipe the token to the product CLI via stdin only: `login --token-stdin` (or the product's equivalent).
   - Do **not** put the token on argv, in chat echo, in logs, or in screenshots.
   - Confirm success with masked doctor/whoami only.

2. **Plaintext token in chat (allowed, discouraged).** If the human pastes a raw `jz_…` into the conversation:
   - **Warn once** in plain language: prefer a local file path next time so the secret is not retained in chat history; do **not** refuse.
   - Proceed immediately: feed that value to `login --token-stdin` via a non-echoing agent-side pipe (temp file mode 0600 deleted after use is OK; never `echo TOKEN |` in a way that lands in shell history if avoidable).
   - Do not repeat the raw token back in the reply.

3. **No token yet.** Ask the human to send either a **file path** (best) or paste the token. Still do not ask them to run terminal commands.

Hard rules:

- `--token <value>` / argv secrets remain **forbidden** for the CLI.
- Agent may read a user-supplied path and stdin-feed the CLI; that is the supported file path.
- After any successful connect, other plugins must not re-prompt when `user.json` is present.


# Record EasyBooks transactions

All commands shell out to the bundled `easybooks` CLI. Resolve it once via `easybooks-capabilities/SKILL.md` §B and invoke that exact path; do not rely on ambient `PATH`. All output is JSON on stdout; structured errors go to stderr with a non-zero exit.

**Cardinal rule:** every write goes through the bundled CLI. Never bypass it with a direct backend request or a database write. The agent may parse files locally to extract facts, but the moment data is recorded it goes through `easybooks`.

## Two paths: quick entry vs document import

| Situation | Path |
|---|---|
| User states a single transaction in words ("log a $120 software expense on 2026-05-01") | **Quick entry** — `easybooks expense add` / `income add` |
| User gives a file or pastes content (receipt, supplier invoice, screenshot, PDF, Excel/CSV, statement, email, free text describing purchases) | **Document import** — parse locally → Entry JSON → `tx import-json --dry-run` → confirm → record |

## Quick entry (single, stated in words)

```sh
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" expense add --amount 120.00 --description "Adobe Creative Cloud" --date 2026-05-01 \
  [--category "Software"] [--classification business|personal] [--notes "..."] [--dry-run]
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" income add --amount 1500.00 --description "Consulting payment" --date 2026-05-03 \
  [--category "Consulting"] [--classification business|personal] [--dry-run]
```

- `--amount` is a decimal (dollars), e.g. `120.00`. (Batch import JSON uses integer `amount_cents` instead — don't mix the two.)
- `--date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `--category` is a **name**; the backend resolves it to an id. Never pass a `category_id`. If unsure what categories exist, run `categories list` first.
- `--classification` is one of the three deductibility labels — see **Classify every receipt** below. Never silently default an unknown purchase to `business`; ask, or mark it needs-review. Classification affects what the user can deduct.
- For a value you parsed from a document (not stated by the user), prefer the import path so it carries a `--source-id` / `source_id` for idempotency.

## Resolve categories (never guess an id)

```sh
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" categories list --type expense
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" categories list --type income
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" categories list            # both types
```

Use this to map a user's wording ("software", "subscriptions") to a real category name before recording, or to tell the user what categories are available. You pass names to `expense add` / `income add` / Entry JSON; the backend does the name→id resolution.

## Document import: the file-import decision tree (the core path)

The CLI is JSON-first. It does **not** read local file paths. The agent reads the file locally, converts it to Entry JSON, then sends that JSON through the CLI.

| Source material | How the agent parses it locally | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Excel / XLSX / CSV table (statement, expense log) | Read the sheet; one row → one Entry. Map columns to amount / date / description / category. | one batch `tx import-json` |
| PDF (supplier invoice, receipt, bank statement) | Extract text; pull amount, date, vendor, tax. | Entry per charge |
| Image / photo / scan of a receipt | OCR the image; read total, date, merchant. | usually one Entry |
| Email body / forwarded receipt | Read the text; extract amount, date, vendor. | Entry per receipt (Gmail flow → use `easybooks-gmail`) |
| Plain text the user pasted | Parse the described transactions. | Entry per transaction |

### Mandatory sequence

```sh
# 1. Agent parses the user's file(s)/text locally → builds the Entry JSON below.
# 2. Dry-run: validates + echoes resolved rows, writes nothing.
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" tx import-json --json '<json>' --dry-run
# 3. Show the user the resolved rows (amount, date, category, classification, type). Get confirmation.
# 4. Record for real (same JSON, no --dry-run):
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" tx import-json --json '<json>'
```

### Entry JSON shape (do not invent fields)

Envelope (the user is identified by the platform token, so no owner id is sent):
```json
{
  "source_system": "receipt-drop",
  "entries": [ <Entry>, <Entry>, ... ]
}
```

Each `<Entry>`:
```json
{
  "type": "income|expense",
  "amount_cents": 12000,
  "description": "Adobe Creative Cloud — May",
  "date": "2026-05-01",
  "category_name": "Software",
  "classification": "business",
  "source_type": "receipt|invoice|email|statement",
  "source_id": "stable-unique-id",
  "source_payload": { "vendor": "Adobe", "raw_total": "120.00" }
}
```

- **`amount_cents` is an integer** (cents). $120.00 → `12000`. Do the conversion when you build the JSON.
- **`source_id` is REQUIRED for imports** and must be stable for the same underlying document. Good choices: the supplier invoice number, a hash of `(vendor + date + amount)` for a statement line, the receipt number, or the email/Gmail message id. This is what makes re-imports safe.
- `category_name` is optional; the backend resolves the name to an id. For `classification` see **Classify every receipt** below.
- Zero-amount rows are skipped server-side.
- An entry can carry the original document inline as `receipt: { filename, content_type, content_base64 }`, OR you can attach it after recording with `tx attach-receipt` (see **Attach the original document**).

## Classify every receipt — business / mixed / personal

Every recorded expense needs a deductibility classification. There are **three** labels:

| Label | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `business` | Fully deductible — wholly a business cost | software subscription, client lunch, professional fees |
| `mixed` | **Partially deductible** — split business/personal use | a phone bill, a car cost, a home-office utility |
| `personal` | **Pure personal** — not deductible at all | groceries, a personal Netflix plan |

Rules:
- After recording (or while building the Entry JSON), set the right label.
- **If you are unsure, ask the user one specific question.** Do **not** silently default an unknown purchase to `business`.
- When it stays unknown after asking, mark it **needs-review** (leave classification unset / flag it to the user) — never guess `business` to make the row "complete".
- **Correcting a classification teaches the system.** When the user fixes a label with `tx reclassify <id> --class <label> --learn`, the backend remembers that *sender/source* and classifies future transactions from them the same way. So a one-time correction pays off on every later receipt from that vendor.

```sh
# Correct a recorded transaction and teach the system to remember this sender:
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" tx reclassify <transaction_id> --class business|mixed|personal --learn
# Without --learn it just corrects this one transaction (no learning):
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" tx reclassify <transaction_id> --class mixed
```

## Attach the original document

Keep the source document with the transaction so the books are audit-ready. Two ways:

1. **Inline on ingest** — add a `receipt` object to the Entry:
   ```json
   { "...": "...", "receipt": { "filename": "adobe-may.pdf", "content_type": "application/pdf", "content_base64": "<base64>" } }
   ```
2. **After recording** — attach the file by path; the CLI reads it, guesses the content type by extension, base64-encodes it, and uploads:
   ```sh
   "$EASYBOOKS_BIN" tx attach-receipt <transaction_id> --file /path/to/receipt.pdf
   ```
   - Supported types: `png`, `jpg/jpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, `heic`, `heif`, `pdf`.
   - Files over **10 MB are refused locally** with a clear error — compress or attach a smaller copy.
   - On success the CLI prints the `receipt_url` where the document now lives.

When the user "drops a receipt", the ideal flow is: record the transaction **and** attach the original document, then classify it.

## Idempotency — read this before recording

Recorded rows are upserted on **`(user_id, source_system, source_id)`**. That means:

- Running the **same** import twice does **not** create duplicates. The second run reports the rows under `existing`, not `created`.
- The output is `{ "created":n, "existing":n, "skipped":n, "processed":n }`. After a re-run you should expect `created: 0` and `existing` equal to the previously created count — **that is success, not a failure**. Do not "retry to fix it".
- Therefore: pick a **deterministic** `source_id`. If you generate a random id each run you defeat idempotency and will double-record. Never do that.
- Keep `source_system` stable per source (e.g. `receipt-drop`, `bank-statement`, `gmail`). The same document recorded under two different `source_system` values WILL appear twice — that's two distinct idempotency keys.

## Quick router (user intent → exact command)

| If the user says… | Run |
|---|---|
| "log a $X expense for `<thing>` on `<date>`" | `"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" expense add --amount <d> --description "<t>" --date <YYYY-MM-DD> [--category "<name>"]` |
| "record $X income / a payment I received on `<date>`" | `"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" income add --amount <d> --description "<t>" --date <YYYY-MM-DD> [--category "<name>"]` |
| "record this receipt / supplier invoice / screenshot / PDF" | parse locally → Entry JSON → `tx import-json --json '<json>' --dry-run` → confirm → rerun without `--dry-run` |
| "import this spreadsheet / CSV / bank statement of expenses" | parse rows locally → batch Entry JSON → `tx import-json --dry-run` → confirm → rerun |
| "this should be personal / mixed, not business" / "fix the classification" | `"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" tx reclassify <id> --class business\|mixed\|personal [--learn]` |
| "attach the receipt / PDF to this transaction" | `"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" tx attach-receipt <id> --file <path>` |
| "what categories do I have" | `"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" categories list [--type income\|expense]` |
| "scan my Gmail for receipts" | hand off to **easybooks-gmail** (uses `gmail record`, source_id = message id) |

## Default behavior & confirmation

- A single quick `expense add` / `income add` where the user stated every field can be run directly.
- For **any document import**, always `--dry-run` first and show the resolved rows. Money accuracy beats a saved round-trip. Confirm amounts and the business/personal classification.
- If classification or category is ambiguous, ask one specific question — don't silently default to `business` on a personal or mixed purchase. An unknown that stays unknown is **needs-review**, not `business`.
- When you record a dropped receipt/expense, also (a) classify it business / mixed / personal and (b) attach the original document (inline `receipt` on the entry, or `tx attach-receipt` after). A correction with `tx reclassify --learn` teaches the system to remember that sender.
- When the CLI returns a structured error with a `hint`, surface it verbatim.

## Governance

- The CLI **defaults to the PROD backend** (`https://easybooks.jackyzhang.app`, the immicore eb-plugin via the eb frontend nginx `/api` proxy); the legacy Node `http://localhost:8080` is no longer the default. Override to test (`https://easybooks-test.jackyzhang.app`) or LAN (`http://192.168.1.69:8310`) via `--base-url`. Recording there is a production mutation: require the explicit current-session authorization named by the platform-vault project card (see `easybooks-capabilities` §G), or stop.
- Recording requires write scope. If the CLI returns a scope/permission error, the user's platform token lacks it — have them recheck their Portal token scope. Do not send them to the EasyBooks web app to mint an API key; `eb_live_` keys are retired.
- Never print the user's platform token; show masked identifiers only. It lives in `~/.jackyzhang.app/token/user.json`.
