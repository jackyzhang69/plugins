# EasyBooks plugin — agent consumption contract

## Talk to the human (mandatory)

Speak in everyday words. Say what you are doing and what happens next. Do not
lead with binary paths, `--help`, or raw JSON. Keep CLI and JSON between
tools. Never show credentials, bank data, or receipt contents in chat unless
the user asked for that detail.

## Live CLI surface (fail-closed)

Ask the live CLI, never from memory of an older release:

```bash
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" commands --json
```

Playbooks: [connect](references/connect.md), [record](references/record.md),
[invoice](references/invoice.md), [gmail](references/gmail.md),
[tell-jacky](references/tell-jacky.md).

## Shared platform token (host agent — mandatory)

- Canonical durable user credential: `~/.jackyzhang.app/token/user.json` (`jz_` only).
- **One connect for the whole platform.** If this file already exists from any other official plugin, do **not** ask the human to log in again.
- On load, if `user.json` is missing but a legacy on-disk `jz_` exists (`token/user.json`, product-local config token fields), **migrate immediately** by running this product's CLI `whoami`/`doctor`/any authenticated command (load-time migrate is built in). User must feel no re-paste.
- Only when no migratable `jz_` exists: complete connect once using the token-delivery rules below. After that, every registered plugin reuses the same slot.
- Never print or log the raw token. Prefer masked doctor/whoami output.
- Do not create product-local durable token files.

## Token delivery to the host agent (connect) — LOCKED 2026-08-14

The host agent performs connect **for** the human. **Never** tell the human to open a terminal and run login commands themselves.

Accept input in this order:

1. **File containing the token (preferred).** If the human provides a filesystem path (e.g. `~/Desktop/jacky-token.txt`) or an attached/readable file whose contents are a single `jz_…` value (optional surrounding whitespace/newline only):
   - Read the file in the agent tool channel.
   - Pipe the token to the product CLI via stdin only: `login --token-stdin` (or the product's equivalent).
   - Do **not** put the token on argv, in chat echo, in logs, or in screenshots.
   - Confirm success with masked doctor/whoami only.

2. **Plaintext token in chat (allowed, discouraged).** If the human pastes a raw `jz_…` into the conversation:
   - **Warn once** in plain language: prefer a local file path next time so the secret is not retained in chat history; do **not** refuse.
   - Proceed immediately: feed that value to `login --token-stdin` via a non-echoing agent-side pipe (temp file mode 0600 deleted after use is OK; never `echo TOKEN |` in a way that lands in shell history if avoidable).
   - Do not repeat the raw token back in the reply.

3. **No token yet.** Ask the human to send either a **file path** (best) or paste the token. Still do not ask them to run terminal commands.

Hard rules:

- `--token <value>` / argv secrets remain **forbidden** for the CLI.
- Agent may read a user-supplied path and stdin-feed the CLI; that is the supported file path.
- After any successful connect, other plugins must not re-prompt when `user.json` is present.


# EasyBooks plugin — agent consumption contract

**Read this once on plugin load and reload it whenever a user asks anything EasyBooks-related.** It tells you which skill / subcommand to call for each user intent, what to never guess, and where the production safety gate is.

EasyBooks is a self-employed (Canadian) finance app: income/expense transactions, categories, clients, and invoices. This plugin lets an agent record bookkeeping through one bundled CLI instead of touching the database or backend directly.

## 0. Non-negotiable operating rules

1. **All EasyBooks system operations go through the bundled CLI.** Reads (categories / clients / invoices), recording income/expense, importing parsed documents, creating invoices, and sending invoices must use `<easybooks> ...`. Do **not** call EasyBooks backend endpoints directly and do **not** write to Supabase / any database directly. The CLI is the only boundary.
2. **Local file parsing is allowed only before the CLI boundary.** The agent may read Excel, CSV, PDF, image (receipt photo / scan), email, or plain text locally to extract facts. The moment data is recorded, listed, or mutated, call the CLI.
3. **Never guess ids.** Resolve category names and client names to ids by recording with names (the backend resolves them) or by listing first (`categories list`, `clients find`, `invoices list`). Do not invent a `category_id` or `client_id`.
4. **Idempotency is mandatory for any recorded document.** Every parsed receipt / invoice / email row carries a stable `source_id`. Re-running the same import must not double-record. For Gmail, `source_id` is the Gmail message id (see `references/gmail.md`).
5. **Production is the default; writes are gated.** The CLI defaults to the PROD backend (`https://easybooks.jackyzhang.app`, the immicore eb-plugin via the eb frontend nginx `/api` proxy). Override to test (`https://easybooks-test.jackyzhang.app`) or LAN (`http://192.168.1.69:8310`) via `--base-url`. Follow the current platform-vault project card and require its current-session authorization before a production mutation — see §G.

## §B. Resolving the `easybooks` binary

The plugin ships a Rust CLI binary that is NOT placed on `PATH` automatically by either Codex or Claude Code. Throughout these skills, `<easybooks>` or the literal token `easybooks` mean **"the bundled binary at this resolved path"**, not a `PATH` lookup.

**Resolution order (use the first that resolves to an existing executable):**

1. **`$EASYBOOKS_BIN`** — explicit override. Honor if set.
2. **Claude Code plugin dir** — `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/<platform>/easybooks` (Claude Code sets `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` when invoking a plugin's skill).
3. **Codex plugin cache** — `$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache/jacky-plugins/easybooks-cli/<highest-version>/bin/<platform>/easybooks` where `<highest-version>` is the highest version dir present and `<platform>` matches the OS/arch.
4. **`command -v easybooks`** — if the user has installed it on PATH manually (last resort).

The public bundle currently supports `darwin-arm64` and `win32-x64` (binary is `easybooks.exe` on Windows). Other hosts require an explicit trusted `EASYBOOKS_BIN` or PATH installation.

**Portable resolver (bash; works on darwin / linux; for Windows agents use the PowerShell variant below):**

```bash
# Detect platform → cache subdir name used by both codex and claude.
case "$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" in
  Darwin-arm64)  PLAT=darwin-arm64 ;;
  *) PLAT= ;;
esac

# Walk a search list in priority order; pick first existing executable.
EASYBOOKS_BIN_RESOLVED=""
_cand_paths=(
  "${EASYBOOKS_BIN:-}"
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+${PLAT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/$PLAT/easybooks}}"
)
# Codex cache may have several version dirs; agent picks the *highest* one.
# Use python sort (universally available) — POSIX `sort -V` is not portable.
_codex_root="$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache/jacky-plugins/easybooks-cli"
if [ -d "$_codex_root" ]; then
  _latest_codex=$(python3 - "$_codex_root" <<'PY' 2>/dev/null
import os, sys
root = sys.argv[1]
def keyfn(d):
    try:    return tuple(int(x) for x in d.split('.'))
    except: return (-1,)
dirs = [d for d in os.listdir(root) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(root, d))]
dirs.sort(key=keyfn)
print(os.path.join(root, dirs[-1]) if dirs else "", end="")
PY
)
  [ -n "$_latest_codex" ] && [ -n "$PLAT" ] && _cand_paths+=("$_latest_codex/bin/$PLAT/easybooks")
fi
_cand_paths+=("$(command -v easybooks 2>/dev/null)")

for _p in "${_cand_paths[@]}"; do
  if [ -n "$_p" ] && [ -x "$_p" ]; then EASYBOOKS_BIN_RESOLVED="$_p"; break; fi
done

if [ -z "$EASYBOOKS_BIN_RESOLVED" ]; then
  echo "EasyBooks CLI not found on this host. Install the easybooks-cli plugin first." >&2
  return 1 2>/dev/null || exit 1
fi
export EASYBOOKS_BIN="$EASYBOOKS_BIN_RESOLVED"
"$EASYBOOKS_BIN" --help >/dev/null || { echo "EasyBooks CLI at $EASYBOOKS_BIN is not runnable" >&2; return 1 2>/dev/null || exit 1; }
```

**Windows PowerShell variant** (codex on Windows installs to `$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\...`):

```powershell
$plat = "win32-x64"
$cands = @($env:EASYBOOKS_BIN)
if ($env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT) { $cands += "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT\bin\$plat\easybooks.exe" }
$codexRoot = "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\plugins\cache\jacky-plugins\easybooks-cli"
if (Test-Path $codexRoot) {
  $latest = Get-ChildItem $codexRoot -Directory | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '^\d+(\.\d+){1,3}$' } | Sort-Object { [version]$_.Name } | Select-Object -Last 1
  if ($latest) { $cands += "$($latest.FullName)\bin\$plat\easybooks.exe" }
}
$cands += (Get-Command easybooks -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Source
$env:EASYBOOKS_BIN = $cands | Where-Object { $_ -and (Test-Path $_) } | Select-Object -First 1
```

Once `$EASYBOOKS_BIN` is set, **every command in this doc and every other EasyBooks skill** that starts with the bare token `easybooks` should be invoked as `"$EASYBOOKS_BIN"` (bash) / `& $env:EASYBOOKS_BIN` (PowerShell). The bare `easybooks` token is shorthand throughout these docs; the resolution rule applies uniformly.

**Trust-boundary note**: the `command -v easybooks` fallback trusts the ambient PATH. Prefer the explicit cache paths above when both are available; PATH lookup is the last resort, not the canonical answer.

**Why this matters**: writing `easybooks <subcommand>` assuming PATH is set silently fails in Codex (the binary lives in cache, not PATH). Resolve once at session start; don't waste tool calls hunting for it.

## §C. File-drop / paste decision tree (the core "record this document" path)

Use this whenever the user gives you a file or pastes content: receipt photo, scanned PDF, supplier invoice PDF, Excel/CSV export, bank/credit-card statement, an email, or just plain text describing a purchase.

1. **Agent parses the source locally.** Read the Excel/CSV table, OCR the image, extract PDF text, read the email body — whatever it takes to get the facts. The CLI does **not** read local file paths; you do.
2. **Map each line to an Entry JSON object** (shape in §2). One receipt usually = one Entry; a statement / spreadsheet = many Entries in one batch.
3. **Assign a stable `source_id` per entry** so re-imports are idempotent (invoice number, statement line hash, Gmail message id, etc.). Never omit it for document imports.
4. **Dry-run first:** `easybooks tx import-json --json '<json>' --dry-run`. This validates + echoes the resolved rows without writing.
5. **Show the user the resolved rows** (amount, date, category, classification, type). Get confirmation, especially for amounts and business-vs-personal classification.
6. **Record for real:** rerun the same command **without** `--dry-run`. Output is `{ "created":n, "existing":n, "skipped":n, "skipped_personal":n, "processed":n }` — `existing` > 0 means idempotency already had those rows; that is success, not an error. `skipped_personal` > 0 means the server **dropped** entries that resolved to personal (see §1 taxonomy / self-learning) — they were intentionally not booked.

Single quick one-off (no file)? Use `easybooks income add` / `easybooks expense add` directly instead of building batch JSON. Full detail: `references/record.md`.

## 2. Data shapes (do not invent fields)

**Entry** (used by `tx import-json` and `gmail record`):

```json
{
  "type": "income|expense",
  "amount_cents": 12000,
  "description": "Adobe Creative Cloud",
  "date": "2026-05-01",
  "category_name": "Software",          // optional; backend resolves to id
  "classification": "business|mixed|personal", // optional; see taxonomy below — don't silently default to business
  "source_type": "receipt|invoice|email|statement", // optional
  "source_id": "stable-unique-id",      // REQUIRED for idempotency on imports
  "source_payload": { "from": "billing@vendor.com" }, // include sender `from` so the classifier learns by sender
  "receipt": { "filename": "rcpt.pdf", "content_type": "application/pdf", "content_base64": "<base64>" } // optional; original document (or attach later with `tx attach-receipt`)
}
```

### Classification taxonomy + self-learning (READ)

Three deductibility labels — never just two, and never silently default an unknown to `business`:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `business` | Fully deductible — wholly a business cost |
| `mixed` | Partially deductible — split business/personal use |
| `personal` | Pure personal — not deductible |

If unsure, ask one specific question; if it stays unknown, mark it **needs-review** (don't guess `business`).

**Self-learning:** correcting a classification with `easybooks tx reclassify <id> --class <label> --learn` teaches the system to remember that **sender** (keyed off `source_payload.from`), so future transactions from the same sender are classified automatically. Correct once → it remembers. Aggregator senders (e.g. `paypal.com`, `stripe.com`) forward many different merchants, so the system does **not** learn on those — classify those per-receipt.

**Pure-personal is NOT recorded (server-side drop):** an entry that resolves to `personal` is **not booked at all** — no transaction row, no receipt upload — and is returned under `skipped_personal` instead of `created`. It resolves to personal when EITHER the entry carries `classification: "personal"`, OR its sender is one the user has already taught is pure-personal (a confident learned rule, via `reclassify --class personal --learn`). So after you teach a sender as personal, future emails from it are auto-dropped, not recorded. Still submit such entries with `source_payload.from` (don't pre-filter in the agent) — the server decides and reports the count. This applies only to `personal`; `mixed` and not-yet-confident senders are still recorded for review.

`tx import-json` / `gmail record` JSON envelope (the user is identified by the platform token, so no owner id):
```json
{ "source_system": "gmail|receipt-drop|...", "entries": [ <Entry>... ] }
```

**Invoice create** JSON (see `references/invoice.md`):
```json
{
  "client": { "name": "Acme Co", "email": "ap@acme.co" },   // or { "client_id": "<uuid>" }
  "issue_date": "2026-05-01", "due_date": "2026-05-31",
  "tax_rate": 13,
  "items": [ { "description": "Consulting", "quantity": 10, "unit_price": 150 } ],
  "notes": "Net 30", "payment_details": "...", "source_id": "<optional>"
}
```
Server computes subtotal / tax / total and generates the `INV-` invoice number. Amounts in invoice items are decimals (dollars); transaction Entries use integer `amount_cents`.

## §R. Rules — auto-categorization (QB Bank Rules style)

Rules auto-classify / categorize transactions the way QuickBooks Bank Rules do: a transaction is matched against ordered rules and the first matches set its category and/or classification. Use this surface when the user wants to **automate** categorization ("auto-categorize anything from `<sender>` as `<category>`", "make everything matching X business", "set up a rule", "list / disable my rules", "apply my rules to existing transactions"). For a one-off correction of a single transaction, use `tx reclassify` instead — rules are for the repeating case.

| User intent | Command | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| "list my rules" | `easybooks rules list` | `GET /api/integrations/rules` |
| "show rule `<id>`" | `easybooks rules show <rule_id>` | `GET /api/integrations/rules/{id}` |
| "create a rule" | `easybooks rules create --json '<rule json>'` | `POST /api/integrations/rules` |
| "delete rule `<id>`" | `easybooks rules delete <rule_id>` | `DELETE /api/integrations/rules/{id}` |
| "enable / turn on rule `<id>`" | `easybooks rules enable <rule_id>` | `PATCH /api/integrations/rules/{id}` `{enabled:true}` |
| "disable / pause rule `<id>`" | `easybooks rules disable <rule_id>` | `PATCH /api/integrations/rules/{id}` `{enabled:false}` |
| "apply / run my rules over transactions" | `easybooks rules apply --scope <all\|unclassified\|selected> [--ids a,b] [--rule-ids r1,r2] [--only-auto-apply] [--commit]` | `POST /api/integrations/rules/apply` |

**Rule shape** (do not invent fields): `name`, `priority` (integer, **lower = evaluated first**), `enabled`, `match_type` (`all` = every condition must hold | `any` = at least one), `apply_to` (`income` | `expense` | `both`), `auto_apply`, `stop_on_match`, `conditions[]`, `actions[]`.

- **condition**: `field` ∈ `description` | `amount` | `type` | `sender_domain`; `operator` ∈ `contains` | `not_contains` | `equals` | `not_equals` | `starts_with` | `ends_with` | `gt` | `gte` | `lt` | `lte`; `value` (string).
- **action**: `action_type` `set_category` (with `category_id`) **OR** `set_classification` (with `classification` ∈ `business` | `mixed` | `personal`). Resolve `category_id` first via `easybooks categories list` — never invent it.

**`rules apply` defaults to a PREVIEW (dry-run)** — it reports what *would* change without writing. Add `--commit` to actually write. `--scope` is `all` | `unclassified` | `selected` (pair `selected` with `--ids a,b`); `--rule-ids` limits which rules run; `--only-auto-apply` restricts to rules whose `auto_apply` is true. Always show the preview to the user before re-running with `--commit`.

**Keys:** `rules list` / `rules show` need a **read** key; `create` / `delete` / `enable` / `disable` / `apply` need a **read_write** key.

Compact `create --json` example — auto-mark anything from a vendor domain as business:
```json
{ "name": "ACME → business", "priority": 100, "enabled": true, "match_type": "all", "apply_to": "expense", "auto_apply": true, "stop_on_match": true,
  "conditions": [ { "field": "sender_domain", "operator": "contains", "value": "acme.com" } ],
  "actions": [ { "action_type": "set_classification", "classification": "business" } ] }
```

## 3. Skill router by user intent

| User says (any phrasing) | Skill | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| "connect / set up EasyBooks / save my key" | [connect](references/connect.md) | `easybooks login` then `whoami` / `doctor` |
| "log an expense / income", "record this receipt / file / image / PDF / statement", "fix a classification", "attach a receipt" | [record](references/record.md) | `expense add` / `income add` / `tx import-json` / `tx reclassify` / `tx attach-receipt` |
| "create an invoice", "send invoice X", "list my clients / invoices" | [invoice](references/invoice.md) | `invoice create` / `invoice send` / `clients` / `invoices list` |
| "scan my Gmail for receipts / invoices and record them" | [gmail](references/gmail.md) | Gmail MCP read → `gmail record` |
| "is my plugin healthy / which backend am I on" | this file | `easybooks --json doctor` |

## 4. Complete CLI surface by responsibility

| Responsibility | Commands |
|---|---|
| Connect / health | `login`, `whoami`, `doctor` |
| List / search transactions | `tx list [--type income\|expense] [--classification business\|mixed\|personal\|unclassified] [--review needs_review\|reviewed] [--from YYYY-MM-DD] [--to YYYY-MM-DD] [--query <q>] [--limit n]`, `tx receipt-url <id>`, `tx confirm <id>` |
| Record transactions | `income add ...`, `expense add ...`, `tx import-json --json '<json>' [--dry-run]` |
| Edit / classify transactions | `tx update <id> [--amount|--date|--description|--category|--notes] [--dry-run]`, `tx reclassify <id> --class business\|mixed\|personal [--learn]`, `tx attach-receipt <id> --file <path>` |
| Dashboard / summaries | `dashboard [--year YYYY]` |
| Categories | `categories list [--type income\|expense]`, `categories create --name <n> --type income\|expense [--tax-deductible]` |
| Clients | `clients list`, `clients create --name <n> [--email|--phone|--address|--notes]`, `clients update <id> ...`, `clients delete <id>` |
| Invoices | `invoice get <id>`, `invoice create --json '<json>' [--dry-run]`, `invoice send <invoice_id>`, `invoice mark <id> --status paid\|unpaid`, `invoice pdf <id> [--out <path>]`, `invoice stats [--year YYYY]`, `invoices list [--status <s>]` |
| Rules (auto-categorization) | `rules list`, `rules show <id>`, `rules create --json '<json>'`, `rules delete <id>`, `rules enable\|disable <id>`, `rules apply --scope <all\|unclassified\|selected> [--ids ..] [--rule-ids ..] [--only-auto-apply] [--commit]` (preview unless `--commit`) — see §R |
| Gmail (v1) | `gmail record --json '<json>' [--dry-run]` (alias of `tx import-json`, `source_system` defaults to `gmail`), `gmail sync` (v1 stub) |

Treat `<easybooks> --help` as runtime truth when docs and code drift.

## 5. Execution mode boundary — local vs backend

| Step | Where it runs | Network |
|---|---|---|
| Parsing files / OCR / reading Excel-CSV-PDF-email | **Local (agent)** | none |
| Reading Gmail candidate messages | **Local (Gmail MCP)** | the MCP's own |
| `categories/clients/invoices list/find`, `whoami`, all records, `tx reclassify`, `tx attach-receipt`, `invoice create/send`, `gmail record` | **Backend** call (HTTP to the configured base-url) | required |
| `doctor --no-fetch` | **Local** config read | none |
| `doctor` (default) / `whoami` | **Backend** round-trip | required |

The CLI talks to the EasyBooks backend integration endpoints under `/api/integrations/...`. The agent never hits those endpoints itself.

## 6. Default execution behavior

- If intent is unambiguous AND the operation is **not** a money mutation that needs review (a single tiny `expense add` with all fields known), you may run it directly.
- For **document imports and invoices**, always `--dry-run` first and show the resolved rows/totals before the real write. Money accuracy matters more than a round-trip.
- For **`invoice send`** (emails a client) treat it as destructive: confirm once with the user, then run.
- For **ambiguous intent** (which category? business or personal? which client?), ask one specific clarifying question rather than guessing.
- When the CLI returns a structured error with a `hint`, surface it verbatim — the CLI is the source of truth for what to try next.

### 6.1 Parallelize reads, serialize the config write

The CLI is stateless per invocation. Run independent **reads** in parallel — e.g. `categories list` + `clients list` + `invoices list` when staging an invoice. The only thing that is **serial** is `login` (it writes the shared token slot `~/.jackyzhang.app/token/user.json` plus the product runtime config). Recording / invoice writes are independent across distinct `source_id`s, but prefer a single batch `tx import-json` over many parallel `expense add` calls so idempotency and the created/existing counts stay coherent.

## §G. Governance — production gate (REQUIRED, surface to user)

- EasyBooks is governed by the current platform-vault `eb` project card and shared plugin policy. Those canonical files outrank this skill if they change.
- The CLI **defaults to the PROD backend** (`https://easybooks.jackyzhang.app`) — the immicore Go eb-plugin reached via the eb frontend domain's nginx `/api` proxy. The legacy Node backend on `http://localhost:8080` is no longer the default. For non-production work, override to **test** (`https://easybooks-test.jackyzhang.app`) or **LAN** (`http://192.168.1.69:8310`) via `--base-url`.
- Because the default is production, **any write is a production write** and is gated. Before a production mutation, require the explicit current-session authorization named by the project card. If it is absent, stop; do not invent an artifact or reuse an older approval.
- The user's platform token is a secret. Never print or log it. It lives only in the shared slot `~/.jackyzhang.app/token/user.json` (mode 0600). Show only masked identifiers.

## 8. Token & secret rules

- **Never log the token value.** Show only masked identifiers in any output you give the user.
- The credential is the user's durable platform Portal token (`jz_...`), shared by every official Jacky plugin and stored at `~/.jackyzhang.app/token/user.json`. It is sent as `Authorization: Bearer` and both authenticates and identifies the user. Retired `eb_live_` product keys are rejected by the CLI.
- The token lives only in the shared slot `~/.jackyzhang.app/token/user.json` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.jackyzhang.app\token\user.json`). Captured once by any official Jacky plugin.
- Do not write the key anywhere else, do not include it in example commands, do not echo it back.
- Recording, creating invoices, and sending require write scope; read commands need read. A scope/permission error from the CLI means the user's platform token lacks write scope — have them recheck their Portal token, not mint an EasyBooks API key.
